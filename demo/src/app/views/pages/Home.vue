    <h4 class="title is-4">Running the examples</h4>

    <p>Use the menu on the left to navigate the examples.</p>

    <p>The examples are designed to be viewed in parallel with editing the code. For each:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>there are buttons to open the associated files</li>
      <li>source code is clearly commented, with editing suggestions where appropriate</li>
      <li>additional buttons link to any related documentation</li>
    </ul>

    <h4 class="title is-4">Folder structure</h4>

    <p>The example code (for each feature or example) can be found in the <code>src/examples/</code> folder:</p>
    <pre>
+- src
    +- examples
        +- ...
    </pre>

    <p>You can manually navigate to the folders, or as mentioned above, use the edit buttons to jump directly to the
      file.</p>

    <h4 class="title is-4">Using Vue Devtools</h4>

    <p>You will probably want to use Vue Devtools as you run the demo to see the store update.</p>
    <p>As CodeSandbox runs in an iframe, you'll need to open the preview pane in a new window. Click the arrow-like icon
      above the preview pane to do this, then use Vue Devtools as normal.</p>
    <p>Note that you will still be able to edit the code and see the results! CodeSandbox is that cool :)</p>
